Modifications:
- 10/3/2025: Modeifications described below (Gary Lin)
    Following New Classes Added
    ------------------
    - PISConsignmentGenerator:
        * Generate consignments based on existing Plant Inspection System (PIS) records
    - SampleUnit:
        * Manages plant-level sampling units within individual sample_units
        * Provides contamination detection at the plant level
        * Integrates with hierarchical inspection structure
        * Supports numpy array-based plant contamination tracking
    ------------------

    Following Classes Modified
    ----------------
    - InspectionUnit (formerly 'Box'):
        * Extended with sample_unit_objects parameter for hierarchical structure
        * Added material_type attribute to support different materials within a consignment
        * Supports multi-level contamination detection (sample_unit + plant levels)
        * Enhanced with SampleUnit object array for hierarchical access
        * Maintains backward compatibility with original array-based functionality

    - Consignment:
        * Added plant-level attributes (num_plants, plants, plants_per_sample_unit)
        * Enhanced with material_type classification for RBS workflows
        * Supports both traditional sample_unit-based and hierarchical plant-based inspection
        * Added backward compatibility attribute mapping (boxes -> inspection_units, items -> sample_units)
        * Enhanced count_contaminated() method for flexible contamination counting
    ----------------

    New Functions Added
    ----------------
    - get_sample_units_per_inspection_unit():
        * Determines sample_units per inspection_unit based on pathway type
        * Supports pathway-specific packaging configurations
        * Handles backward compatibility for items_per_box

    - sample_unit_in_inspection_unit_to_sample_unit_index():
        * Converts local sample_unit index within inspection_unit to global sample_unit index
        * Essential for hierarchical structure navigation and detailed tracking

    - get_inspection_unit_and_sample_unit_index():
        * Converts global sample_unit index to inspection_unit and local sample_unit indices
        * Supports bidirectional navigation in hierarchical structure
    ----------------

    Following Functions Modified
    ----------------
    - get_consignment_generator():
        * Supports RBS generation method selection (parameter-based and record-based)
        * Enhanced backward compatibility for configuration parameter mapping
        * Handles both old terminology (items_per_box) and new terminology (sample_units_per_inspection_unit)
        * Automatically selects PISConsignmentGenerator when file_type="PIS" is specified for RBS method
    - get_items_per_box():
        * Renamed get_plants_per_sample_unit() and updated to match plant terminology
        * Determines number of plants per sample_unit based on pathway type
        * Supports pathway-specific plant quantity configurations
        * Handles backward compatibility for plants_per_item
    ----------------

    Terminology Refactoring
    ----------------
    - Systematically refactored: boxes -> inspection_units, items -> sample_units
    - Updated all class names, method names, and variable names for consistency
    - Added comprehensive backward compatibility for existing configurations
    - Maintained dual access patterns for smooth migration from legacy terminology
    ----------------

    Backward Compatibility
    ----------------
    - Configuration parameter mapping: boxes -> inspection_units, items -> sample_units
    - Legacy attribute access in Consignment class via __getattr__ and __hasattr__
    - Support for both items_per_box and sample_units_per_inspection_unit configuration keys
    - Maintained existing F280 and AQIM consignment generator functionality
